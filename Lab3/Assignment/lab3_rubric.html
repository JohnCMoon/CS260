  <h1>Lab01 Grading Rubric</h1>

  <h2>Functional Grading Components</h2>

  <p>
    The following table lists the grade components for the functional requirement.  The first two items (fails to compile, crashes) will override all other components.
  </p>

  <table class="calendar" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td>Component</td>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fails to compile</td>
      <td>The program fails to compile. In this case it is difficult to evaluate the functionality so no other functional components are considered.</td>
      <td>-75</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Program crashes or hangs</td>
      <td>The program crashes or gets into an infinite loop.  In this case it is difficult to evaluate the functionality so no other functional components are considered.</td>
      <td>-50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Compiles with warnings</td>
      <td>The program compiles with warnings but it runs without crashing or hanging.</td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Major memory leaks</td>
      <td>More than one memory leak. Usually due to missing or improperly implemented destructor.</td>
      <td>-10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Minor memory leak</td>
      <td>Just one (or two, if related) small memory leaks. Usually due to forgetting to delete a temporarily allocated item.</td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Major output mismatch</td>
      <td>There are several missing lines of output, they are out of order, or they are plain wrong.</td>
      <td>-10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Minor output mismatch</td>
      <td>Missing one or two lines, pervasive punctuation, spelling or capitalization errors.</td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Trivial output mismatch</td>
      <td>A single trivial error in punctuation, spelling or capitalization errors.</td>
      <td>-2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Missing feature</td>
      <td>A feature listed in the requirements is not implemented.  This will likely also cause a major output mismatch. This penalty is &quot;per feature&quot;.</td>
      <td>-5 (per feature)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Design Grading Components</h2>

  <p>
    The following table lists the grade components for the design
    requirement.  These are the items I evaluate when detemining the
    design grade.  This assumes that the program code is mostly
    complete.  For program code that is incomplete the design score
    will be reduced in proportion to the amount of missing code.
  </p>

  <table class="calendar" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td>Component</td>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Public data members</td>
      <td>
	You should not have any public data members in your classes.
	Use getters/setters to read/write these members.
      </td>
      <td>-10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Poor identifier names</td>
      <td>
	Make sure your classes, methods, variables, etc. are named
	with sensible names.
      </td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Poor cohesion/coupling</td>
      <td>
	Your program design should make sure that each method or
	function just does one thing and that each class is well
	encapsulated.
      </td>
      <td>-10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Repeated code</td>
      <td>
	You shouldn&#39;t find yourself repeating the same lines of code
	over and over again.  If you do then you need to refactor to a
	helper function/method.  It is common for people to repeat
	code in the copy constructor and assignment operator.  Try to
	avoid this.
      </td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Overly complex control structure</td>
      <td>
	Try to use simple and straight-forward control statements (if, for, while, etc.)
      </td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Too clever code</td>
      <td>
	Your code is overly clever which makes it hard to understand
	and even harder to debug.
      </td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Using char[] for strings</td>
      <td>It is a design flaw to use fixed size character arrays for
      strings.  This can very easily lead to character buffer
      overflow problems that you will only discover at runtime with
      specific data.</td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Missing copy constructor and/or assignment operator</td>
      <td>
	Any class that needs a destructor also needs a copy
	constructor and assignment operator.  The reason is because
	you (the class author) don&#39;t have control over how the client
	code will use your class.  Without a copy constructor you are
	susceptible to problems if the client code making copies of
	your class and destroying the copy.  The same reasoning
	applies to the assignment operator.
      </td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Break statements</td>
      <td>
	While the C++ language allows for break statements in loops,
	it is better design practice to avoid this.  In nearly all
	cases a break can be avoided.
      </td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Multiple return statements</td>
      <td>
	Each method in your classes should have no more than one
	return statement.  There is a exception to this when there is
	a simple if/return at the very beginning of the method.  It is
	not technically illegal to have multiple returns but it is
	better design to have a single one.
      </td>
      <td>-5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Embedded hash table functionality</td>
      <td>
      It is best to have your data structure as a separate class
      rather than embed it in the application code.  This is a higher
      level of modularity.  It allows for more code resue, easier
      debugging, and easier maintenance.
      </td>
      <td>-10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Integer literals</td>
      <td>
	It is good programming practice to define all integer literals
	(except 0) as a constant and then refer to that constant.  The
	two main reasons for this are that 1) it allows you to easily
	change the value; 2) it allows someone to understand the
	program better when they read it.
      </td>
      <td>-2</td>
