<h1>CS260 Lab: Inventory</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
  Being an incurable computer geek, you have toyed around with the
  idea of creating your own RPG or adventure game.  Of course there
  are so many aspects of an adventure game it is nearly impossible to
  consider them all at once so you have decided to start small.  Very
  small.  You are going to write just the "inventory" part of the
  game. 
</p>

<p>
  Every player in the game has an inventory of the items he/she has.
  Items such as swords, helmets, potions, gold, and so on.  Each
  player can have more than one of any item but they also have a limit
  on the total weight they can carry.  Players can see the list of all
  of the items in their inventory.  They can add and remove items from
  the list as well.
</p>

<p>
  Items are identified by their name and the names are case
  insensitive. For example, "helmet", "Helmet", and "HELMET" should
  all be considered the same sort of thing (that is, count 3 of them,
  not 3 different things).
</p>

<p>
  If the program tries to insert a duplicate item (by checking the
  name) but the new item's weight is different than the weight of the
  existing item you should print an error message (see the sample
  output to see what the message should say) and the item should NOT
  be inserted into the list.
</p>

<p>
  You have decided to implement the inventory as a linked list of
  items.  The inventory list will support the ability to add an item,
  remove an item, get the total count of items, the total weight, and
  display the list.
</p>

<h2>Implementation Requirements</h2>

<p>
  Your implementation should have a class called "inventory" that
  manages the entire inventory of your player. You will also need a
  class called "item" that contains the information about each item.
</p>

<h3>The "item" class</h3>

<p>
  The "item" class is intended to hold the details about a particular
  item.  Each item has a name (e.g. "red potion") and a weight
  (e.g. 2.0).  The weight should be a double.  The "item" class should
  have a constructor that takes in a char* name and a double weight.
  You are free to add any other methods that you need.
</p>

<h3>The "inventory" class</h3>

<p>
  The "inventory" class is intended to hold all of the items in a
  linked list. The "inventory" class should also maintain a "max
  weight" data member that specifies the maximum weight that this
  particular inventory can hold.  One of the "inventory" constructors
  should set the default value for the weight to be 100.  There should
  be another constructor that allows for the weight to be passed in.
</p>

<p>
  The "inventory" class should contain a method called "AddItem".
  This method will take in a new "item" object and add it to the
  inventory.  Items need to be saved in the linked list in
  alphabetical order.  Also, duplicate items should not be added as
  new nodes but instead, the program should maintain an "item count"
  for each item.  When a duplicate item is added to the inventory then
  the item count for that item should be incremented.
</p>

<p>
  The "inventory" class should contain a method called "RemoveItem".
  This method takes a char* parameter, finds the node in the linked
  list with that name, and removes that item.  Since there could be
  duplicate items in the inventory, the remove method needs to be able
  to just decrement the item count (see above) instead of remove the
  node from the linked list.
</p>

<p>
  The "inventory" class needs to have GetCount() and GetWeight()
  methods that return the current item count and total weight.  You
  are free to calculate this information on an "as needed" basis or
  keep a class member variable that holds the information.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, the "inventory" class needs to have a PrintInventory()
  method that displays the inventory. Be sure to examine the sample
  output (below) to see the exact format of the inventory output.
</p>

<p>
  You may find it helpful to create a node structure that encapsulates
  the "item", the item count, and the next pointer.  It's not a
  functional requirement but I think you will find this makes it
  easier to write the program.
</p>

<h3>Other requirements</h3>

<p>
  This assignment includes a main.cpp file.  You must use this exact
  main.cpp file without any modifications for your program.  In order
  for this to work correctly you will need to make sure to use correct
  file names "inventory.h" and "item.h".  You will also need to make
  sure to name your classes and methods as described above.
</p>

<p>
  When you run your program using this main function your program
  should generate the output shown in the expected.txt file (included
  with the assignment).  You need to match the text exactly including
  spaces and newlines.
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>
  On assignments like this many students encounter the same sort of
  problems.  Here are some hints on how to avoid the common pitfalls.
</p>

<p><b>Don't use char[] as the "name" for your item</b> You will find
  lots of examples online, and even in some of the book code and
  examples in this course, that use char[somesize] to hold a string.
  This ok for small examples and in isolated code where you KNOW the
  size of the string data that will be in the char[].  This doesn't
  work for the field in a class.  You don't know beforehand how long
  the strings are going to be.  You need to use dynamically allocated
  char* data.
</p>

<p><b>Don't use break statements</b>  At least 99% of the time break
  statements are not needed in loops.  There is almost always a better
  way to structure the code so that a break statement is not needed.
  You will find that with better code structure your program is easier
  to write, debug, and maintain.
</p>

<p><b>Only one return statement per method</b> It is almost a
  guarantee that I will deduct points from your assignment if you have
  more than one return statement in a single method.  The rationale
  here is similar to the arguement I make for not using break
  statements.  
</p>

<p><b>Case-insensitive string comparison is tricky</b> The
  case-insensitive comparison of the names for items is a tricky part
  of this assignment.  Make sure you give yourself enough time to work
  through it.
</p>

<h2>To Submit This Assignment</h2>

<p>
  First, "clean" your project by doing the following: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    execute <strong>Clean Solution</strong> in
    the <strong>Build</strong> menu
  </li>
  <li>
    close Visual Studio, and then delete the <strong>.ncb</strong>
    file from your solution's root folder
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

  After cleaning your project, compress it
  into <strong>lab1.zip</strong>. Make sure you have your Zip
  application set to <em>preserve the folder structure</em> of your
  project, and make sure that your .zip file <em>will extract into a
  single folder</em>, the way that the .zip files from this course do.

  <br/>

  Doing these things will ensure that your .zip file is as small as
  possible, which will make both your upload and my download quicker.

  <br/>

  Submit the .zip file containing your cleaned project to Desire2Learn.
